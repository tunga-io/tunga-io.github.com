# Tunga General Development Guidelines

## Glossary:
API - Application Programming Interface
DRY - Don’t Repeat Yourself

IDE - Integrated Development Environment

LTS - Long Term Support

oData - Open Data Protocol

REST - Representational State Transfer

SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol

VCS - Version Control System

## Guidelines:
### Code quality:
- Don’t reinvent the wheel, leverage existing libraries and frameworks.
- Write DRY and modular code by leveraging available language constructs like inheritance, interfaces, mixins and closures where possible.
- Follow language, framework and platform conventions, styles and architectural guides to keep code readable and easy to maintain e.g iOS [https://developer.apple.com/libr...](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH7-SW24), Android <https://developer.android.com/guide/>, Python <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>, Java <https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html> 
- Leverage standardized architectures and protocols when building web services e.g REST, SOAP, oDATA.
- Use linters <https://github.com/collections/clean-code-linters> and editorconfig files <http://editorconfig.org/> to define coding styles.

### Dependency management:
- Use industry standard dependency management tools (e.g bundler for Ruby, pip for Python, npm or yarn for NodeJS, bower for JavaScript, maven for Java). 
- Leverage a module bundler for frontend JavaScript projects (e.g webpack <https://webpack.js.org/>).
-Use stable and LTS versions (where possible) of all development tools (including languages, libraries, frameworks, VCS and dependency management tools) to ensure quick bug fixes and security updates
- Commit lock files generated by dependency management tools to VCS for deterministic dependency resolution.

### Version Control:
- Use a modern VCS to manage code e.g Git (preferrably because of widespread adoption), mercurial or subversion.
- Backup source code with a cloud based hosting service e.g GitHub (free for public <https://github.com/>), Bitbucket (free for private but has limit on size of team <https://bitbucket.org/product>), Gitlab (free for unlimited team members and number of repos <https://about.gitlab.com/>).
- Keep IDE setup files out of VCS (e.g .idea and .vscode folders).
- The master branch should only include code ready for production, as such, don’t work directly from the master branch. Always create feature branches for contributing/adding new features or create a generic branch e.g “develop” for changes which are not yet ready for production.


### Versioning:
- Follow semver (<https://semver.org/>) for versioning.
- Create version tags for important releases in the VCS.
- Use API versioning to prevent breaking dependent client applications when updating mature (already in production and consumed by other live/production clients) APIs.

### Secrets, passwords and private keys:
- Keep secrets, passwords and private keys out of the VCS.
- Store secrets and passwords as environment variables or using .env files that are not committed to the VCS.

### Documentation:
- Create readme files to make it easy for other contributors to set up and check out the project.
- Define a data dictionary for applications with a storage layer.
- Leverage the OpenAPI <https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification> specification and related libraries to generate API documentation that is easily maintainable.

### Logging:
- Leverage modern tools for error and exception logging and tracking e.g Sentry <https://sentry.io/welcome/> and Crashlytics <https://try.crashlytics.com/>

### Deployment, build and tests:
- Leverage automated deployment (e.g Ansible <https://www.ansible.com/>, Capistrano <http://capistranorb.com/>, Chef <https://www.chef.io/chef/>) 
- Leverage automated build tools (e.g Gradle <https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html>) 
- Leverage unit testing tools and libraries to create automated testing facilities that can be run before integration and deployment.
- Leverage continuous integration tools like travis CI <https://travis-ci.org/> and circleCI <https://circleci.com/>
- Add asset minification and optimization (e.g HTML, JavaScript and CSS minification for web development and image optimization for general development) to your build pipelines.

### Pull requests:
- Keep pull requests focused in scope with one pull request per issue and avoid including unrelated commits.
